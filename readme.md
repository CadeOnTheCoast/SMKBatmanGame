This is Sage's Batman game. The intial conception was just exercise 36 in LTCTHW by Zed - . The exercise instructs the reader to build their onw game. The model that's given immediately prior is a choose your own adventure game that makes liberal use of if, elif, else statements.

It seemed like the exercise would be more fun if my 3 yr old could be involved so I had him help me 'map' out the story for the game and then begin writing.
